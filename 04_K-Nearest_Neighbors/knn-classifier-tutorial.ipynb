Introduction to k Nearest Neighbours algorithm** <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"1\"></a>\n\n[Table of Contents](#0.1)\n\n\nIn machine learning, k Nearest Neighbours or kNN is the simplest of all machine learning algorithms. It is a non-parametric algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. Non-parametric means there is no assumption required for data distribution. So, kNN does not require any underlying assumption to be made. In both classification and regression tasks, the input consists of the k closest training examples in the feature space. The output depends upon whether kNN is used for classification or regression purposes.\n\n-\tIn kNN classification, the output is a class membership. The given data point is classified based on the majority of type of its neighbours. The data point is assigned to the most frequent class among its k nearest neighbours. Usually k is a small positive integer. If k=1, then the data point is simply assigned to the class of that single nearest neighbour.\n\n-\tIn kNN regression, the output is simply some property value for the object. This value is the average of the values of k nearest neighbours.\n\n\nkNN is a type of instance-based learning or lazy learning. Lazy learning means it does not require any training data points for model generation. All training data will be used in the testing phase. This makes training faster and testing slower and costlier. So, the testing phase requires more time and memory resources.\n\nIn kNN, the neighbours are taken from a set of objects for which the class or the object property value is known. This can be thought of as the training set for the kNN algorithm, though no explicit training step is required. In both classification and regression kNN algorithm, we can assign weight to the contributions of the neighbours. So, nearest neighbours contribute more to the average than the more distant ones.\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# **2. k Nearest Neighbours intuition** <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"2\"></a>\n\n[Table of Contents](#0.1)\n\nThe kNN algorithm intuition is very simple to understand. It simply calculates the distance between a sample data point and all the other training data points. The distance can be Euclidean distance or Manhattan distance. Then, it selects the k nearest data points where k can be any integer. Finally, it assigns the sample data point to the class to which the majority of the k data points belong.\n\n\nNow, we will see kNN algorithm in action. Suppose, we have a dataset with two variables which are classified as `Red` and `Blue`.\n\n\nIn kNN algorithm, k is the number of nearest neighbours. Generally, k is an odd number because it helps to decide the majority of the class. When k=1, then the algorithm is known as the nearest neighbour algorithm.\n\nNow, we want to classify a new data point `X` into `Blue` class or `Red` class. Suppose the value of k is 3. The kNN algorithm starts by calculating the distance between `X` and all the other data points. It then finds the 3 nearest points with least distance to point `X`. \n\n\nIn the final step of the kNN algorithm, we assign the new data point `X` to the majority of the class of the 3 nearest points. If 2 of the 3 nearest points belong to the class `Red` while 1 belong to the class `Blue`, then we classify the new data point  as `Red`.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# **3. How to decide the number of neighbours in kNN** <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"3\"></a>\n\n[Table of Contents](#0.1)\n\n\nWhile building the kNN classifier model, one question that come to my mind is what should be the value of nearest neighbours (k) that yields highest accuracy. This is a very important question because the classification accuracy depends upon our choice of k.\n\nThe number of neighbours (k) in kNN is a parameter that we need to select at the time of model building. Selecting the optimal value of k in kNN is the most critical problem. A small value of k means that noise will have higher influence on the result. So, probability of overfitting is very high. A large value of k makes it computationally expensive in terms of time to build the kNN model. Also, a large value of k will have a smoother decision boundary which means lower variance but higher bias.\n\nThe data scientists choose an odd value of k if the number of classes is even. We can apply the elbow method to select the value of k. To optimize the results, we can use Cross Validation technique. Using the cross-validation technique, we can test the kNN algorithm with different values of k. The model which gives good accuracy can be considered to be an optimal choice. It depends on individual cases and at times best process is to run through each possible value of k and test our result.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# **4. Eager learners vs lazy learners** <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"4\"></a>\n\n[Table of Contents](#0.1)\n\nEager learners mean when giving training data points, we will construct a generalized model before performing prediction on given new points to classify. We can think of such learners as being ready, active and eager to classify new data points.\n\nLazy learning means there is no need for learning or training of the model and all of the data points are used at the time of prediction. Lazy learners wait until the last minute before classifying any data point. They merely store the training dataset and waits until classification needs to perform. Lazy learners are also known as instance-based learners because lazy learners store the training points or instances, and all learning is based on instances.\n\nUnlike eager learners, lazy learners do less work in the training phase and more work in the testing phase to make a classification.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# **5.
